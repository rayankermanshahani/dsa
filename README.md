# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

The following is a list of the data structures and algorithms implemented from scratch in C within this repository.

Data Structures:
- dynamic arrays
- linked lists (singly and doubly)
- stacks
- queues
- hash tables
- trees (binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree)
- heaps (min-heap, max-heap)
- graphs (adjacency list and matrix representations)
- trie

Sorting Algorithms:
- bubble sort
- selection sort
- insertion sort
- merge sort
- quick sort
- heap sort
- counting sort
- radix sort

Searching Algorithms:
- linear search
- binary search
- depth-first search (DFS)
- breadth-first search (BFS)

Graph Algorithms:
- dijkstra's shortest path
- bellman-ford algorithm
- floyd-warshall algorithm
- kruskal's minimum spanning tree
- prim's minimum spanning tree
- topological sort

Dynamic Programming:
- fibonacci sequence
- longest common subsequence
